# Flash_fill
Transformed a messy spreadsheet into a clean, structured dataset using Excelâ€™s Flash Fill. No macros, no scriptsâ€”just smart automation and a sharp eye.
## ðŸ”§ How I Cleaned the Data Using Flash Fill

After uploading my messy dataset into Excel, I noticed that the rows were separated by a semicolon (`;`) delimiter. I used Excelâ€™s **Text to Columns** feature to split the data using the semicolon.

Once separated, I realized the names were written in uppercase and formatted incorrectlyâ€”surname before first name. Thatâ€™s when I decided to apply what I recently learned about Flash Fill.

### âœ¨ Steps I Followed:
1. Created a new column using `Ctrl + Shift + +`.
2. Typed the name exactly how I wanted it to appear (e.g., `FirstName LastName`) in the first cell.
3. Pressed `Ctrl + Enter` to lock in the text.
4. Hit `Ctrl + E` to invoke Flash Fillâ€”Excel instantly copied the formatting down the column.
5. Deleted the original messy column to keep things clean.

You can also use the Flash Fill button under the Data tab to achieve the same result.

This simple technique helped me transform a cluttered spreadsheet into a clean, structured datasetâ€”without writing a single formula or macro!
